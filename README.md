The goal of this project was to be my first attempt at working with JavaScript. In this project, I initially created a logical game where a text input was entered into the console, and the results of a rock paper scissors game would be the result. I then expanded on this by working with the DOM to link the clicks of buttons to function inputs. 

Now finished this project, I feel I have more confidence working with the DOM and using the querySelect tool to link my functions with updating results on the site.
